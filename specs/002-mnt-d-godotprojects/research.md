# Research: Event Bus System Fix

## Overview
This research addresses the core requirements from the Event Bus System Fix specification, focusing on memory leaks, thread safety, and resource cleanup issues in the R3 event bus implementation.

## Memory Leak Analysis
- **Current Issue**: R3-based R3EventBus implementation may not be properly disposing of subscriptions or cleanup resources after use
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete resource management in event subscription lifecycle
- **Solution**: Proper disposal of R3 subjects/subscriptions using `using` statements and proper cleanup patterns
- **Reference**: R3 documentation recommends using the `Dispose()` pattern for all subscriptions and observables

## Thread Safety Investigation
- **Current Issue**: Potential race conditions when multiple threads publish/subscribe simultaneously
- **Rationale**: Need thread-safe access to shared event publishing resources
- **Solution**: Implement fine-grained locks as per clarification (balance performance with data consistency)
- **Reference**: R3 already provides thread-safe base, but our wrapper implementation needs additional protection at the framework level

## Event Subscription Lifecycle
- **Issue**: One-time subscriptions may not be auto-disposed after first event
- **Solution**: Use R3's `FirstAsync()` or similar mechanism to ensure One-time subscriptions are automatically cleaned up
- **Implementation**: Create wrapper methods that handle automatic disposal after first occurrence

## Resource Cleanup Strategies
- **Strategy 1**: WeakReference patterns (failed event listeners are automatically cleaned)
- **Strategy 2**: TryGetValue + Remove patterns for thread-safe dictionary manipulation
- **Chosen Approach**: Implement SubscriptionTracker class with proper cleanup methods to prevent accumulation of zombie resources

## Performance Considerations
- **Target**: Up to 1,000 events/second with memory usage under 100MB
- **Implementation**: Leverage existing R3 performance while adding cleanup mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Add memory usage tracking to detect if resources exceed limits

## R3 Reactive Extensions Integration
- **Framework Alignment**: Must maintain consistency with existing R-script friendly architecture
- **Alternatives Considered**: Pure .NET events, Observer pattern, MediatR (already in use)
- **Selected**: Enhance R3EventBus implementation with proper lifecycle management

## Event Format Validation
- **Requirement**: Validate event format validity to satisfy security requirements
- **Implementation**: Add basic validation before processing events, logging any format violations
- **Error Handling**: Log errors instead of interrupting system operation (as per clarifications)

## External Integration Support
- **Connectivity**: Integrate with logging systems and metrics collection
- **Implementation**: Leverage existing IGameLogger interface for basic observability
- **Metrics**: Add performance counters for event processing rate and memory usage

## Decision Summary
The implementation will focus on enhancing the existing `R3EventBus` in `ModularGodot.Core.Infrastructure.Messaging` by:
1. Adding proper resource disposal and cleanup mechanisms
2. Implementing thread-safe subscription management with fine-grained locks
3. Ensuring one-time event subscriptions auto-dispose after first occurrence
4. Adding event validation and error logging functionality
5. Maintaining full compatibility with existing contracts and interfaces
