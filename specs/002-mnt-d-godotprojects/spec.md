**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "结合/mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/.spec-workflow/archive/specs/fix-solution/事件总线系统修复方案.md 生成修复方案"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → User provided: "结合/mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/.spec-workflow/archive/specs/fix-solution/事件总线系统修复方案.md 生成修复方案"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: Event Bus System, Memory Leaks, Thread Safety, Subscription Management, Resource Cleanup, Performance Stability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Define scenarios for system stability, resource management, and concurrent operation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on system reliability and performance
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Event Bus, Subscriptions, Event Publishers, Resource Managers
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a game developer using ModularGodot.Core, I need a stable and reliable event bus system that properly manages memory, handles concurrent operations safely, and prevents test host process crashes during development and testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the event bus system is running for extended periods, **When** I publish and subscribe to events, **Then** the system must not accumulate memory leaks and must properly clean up all resources while maintaining memory usage under 100MB
2. **Given** multiple threads are simultaneously publishing and subscribing to events, **When** concurrent operations occur, **Then** the system must handle all operations safely without race conditions or crashes
3. **Given** I subscribe to events exactly once, **When** the event is published, **Then** my handler must be called exactly one time and the subscription must be automatically cleaned up
4. **Given** the event bus is disposed, **When** I attempt to publish events, **Then** the system must gracefully handle the disposed state without crashing
5. **Given** I am running unit tests and simulated stress tests, **When** tests complete successfully under both real and simulated conditions, **Then** the test host process must not crash due to event bus resource issues or memory accumulation beyond 100MB limit

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system is under high memory pressure?
- How does the system handle rapid subscription and unsubscription cycles?
- What if events are published to a disposed event bus?
- How are orphaned subscriptions handled when subscribers are garbage collected?
- System behavior when approaching memory limit of 100MB
- Event processing when approaching 1,000 events/second threshold

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent memory leaks by properly cleaning up all event subscriptions and subjects when no longer needed
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle concurrent event publishing and subscription using fine-grained locks to balance performance with data consistency, without race conditions or deadlocks
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure that one-time subscriptions are automatically disposed after the first event is received
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain stable memory usage over extended periods of operation with target limit of 100MB
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent test host process crashes during unit test execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST gracefully handle disposed state by throwing EventBusDisposedException without unhandled exceptions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide proper resource cleanup when the event bus is disposed
- **FR-008**: System MUST support high-frequency event operations (up to 1,000 events/second) without accumulating zombie resources
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement basic observability through simple log messages on critical operations and minimal performance metrics
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate event format validity before processing and log errors without interruption of normal system operation
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with external logging and metrics collection systems
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement basic security by validating event format before processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event Bus**: Central component responsible for managing event publishing and subscription lifecycle
- **Event Subscription**: Represents a connection between an event publisher and a handler, with automatic cleanup capabilities
- **Event Publisher**: Component that sends events through the event bus system
- **Resource Manager**: Component responsible for tracking and cleaning up event-related resources
- **Memory Monitor**: Component that tracks memory usage patterns to identify potential leaks
