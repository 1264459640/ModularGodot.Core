# Research: Mediator Pattern Adapter Implementation

## 1. MediatR Best Practices for Adapter Implementation

**Decision**: Use IRequestWrapper pattern with custom handler wrappers
**Rationale**: This approach provides clean separation between the framework's ICommand/IQuery interfaces and MediatR's IRequest interface while maintaining type safety
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct implementation of IRequest in command/query classes (violates dependency inversion)
- Generic adapter methods without wrapper classes (less type-safe)
- Reflection-based approach (performance overhead)

## 2. Cancellation Token Handling in MediatR

**Decision**: Pass cancellation tokens through the entire pipeline
**Rationale**: Ensures cooperative cancellation works correctly from dispatcher to handler
**Alternatives considered**:
- Ignore cancellation tokens (violates requirement)
- Handle only at adapter level (incomplete implementation)

## 3. Exception Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Propagate exceptions directly to callers
**Rationale**: Maintains clarity of error sources and allows callers to handle appropriately
**Alternatives considered**:
- Wrap exceptions in custom types (adds complexity)
- Log and suppress exceptions (violates requirement)

## 4. Dependency Injection with Autofac

**Decision**: Register MediatR adapter as Singleton
**Rationale**: Aligns with clarification requirements and MediatR's recommended usage
**Alternatives considered**:
- Scoped registration (unnecessary overhead)
- Transient registration (inefficient for mediator pattern)

## 5. Type Safety with Generic Constraints

**Decision**: Use compile-time generic constraints
**Rationale**: Provides strong typing without runtime overhead
**Alternatives considered**:
- Runtime type checking (performance cost)
- No type safety (error-prone)

## 6. Performance Optimization for Message Routing

**Decision**: Minimize wrapper object creation through efficient instantiation
**Rationale**: Meets performance goal of <1ms median routing time
**Alternatives considered**:
- Object pooling (premature optimization)
- Complex caching (unnecessary complexity)
