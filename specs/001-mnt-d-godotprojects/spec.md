# Feature Specification: Mediator Pattern Adapter Fix Solution

**Feature Branch**: `001-mnt-d-godotprojects`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "/mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/.spec-workflow/archive/specs/fix-solution/‰∏≠‰ªãËÄÖÊ®°ÂºèÈÄÇÈÖçÂô®‰øÆÂ§çÊñπÊ°à.mdÊ†πÊçÆÊñáÊ°£Âà∂ÂÆöÊñπÊ°àÔºåË¶ÅÊ±ÇËÉΩÈÄöËøáÊµãËØï/mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/src/ModularGodot.Core.XUnitTests/Mediator"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What level of exception handling is expected for command/query processing failures? ‚Üí A: Basic exception propagation (exceptions bubble up to caller)
- Q: What dependency injection lifecycle should the MediatR adapter support? ‚Üí A: Singleton (one instance for the entire application)
- Q: What level of type safety validation is required for commands and queries? ‚Üí A: Compile-time type safety (through generic constraints)
- Q: How should the system respond when no handler is found for a command or query? ‚Üí A: Throw a clear "handler not found" exception
- Q: What level of cancellation token support is required? ‚Üí A: Full implementation (including timeouts and cooperative cancellation)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the ModularGodot.Core framework, I need the Mediator pattern adapter to correctly route commands and queries to their respective handlers so that I can implement clean, decoupled business logic in my Godot game modules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a properly configured Mediator adapter, **When** a command is sent through the IDispatcher interface, **Then** the corresponding command handler should be invoked and return the expected result
2. **Given** a properly configured Mediator adapter, **When** a query is sent through the IDispatcher interface, **Then** the corresponding query handler should be invoked and return the expected result
3. **Given** a Mediator adapter with proper cancellation support, **When** a command or query is sent with a cancellation token, **Then** the operation should respect the cancellation request appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a command handler throws an exception? (Should propagate to caller)
- How does the system handle commands/queries for which no handler is registered? (Should throw a clear "handler not found" exception)
- What happens when the MediatR dependency is not properly configured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST correctly route ICommand implementations to their corresponding ICommandHandler implementations through the MediatR adapter
- **FR-002**: System MUST correctly route IQuery implementations to their corresponding IQueryHandler implementations through the MediatR adapter
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide full cancellation token support when sending commands and queries through the dispatcher (including timeouts and cooperative cancellation)
- **FR-004**: System MUST propagate exceptions thrown by command and query handlers to the caller (basic exception propagation)
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compile-time type safety when wrapping commands and queries for MediatR processing (through generic constraints)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow dependency injection of the MediatR adapter through the Contexts layer configuration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Command**: A request that represents an action to be performed, may change system state
- **Query**: A request that represents a query for data, should not change system state
- **Handler**: A component that processes commands or queries and returns a response
- **Dispatcher**: The mediator component that routes requests to appropriate handlers
