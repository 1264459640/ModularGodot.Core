# Feature Specification: Integration Tests for Production Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `003-mnt-d-godotprojects`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "在/mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/src/ModularGodot.Core.Test中创建集成测试，要求：能在生产环境中完整运行所有基础设施，并且没有报错，只用于测试组件中的通信和包体是否完整"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to create integration tests in the ModularGodot.Core.Test directory that can run the complete production infrastructure to verify component communication and package completeness without errors, so that I can ensure the system works correctly in a production-like environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complete production infrastructure setup, **When** integration tests are executed in the Godot editor, **Then** all components communicate successfully without errors
2. **Given** the ModularGodot.Core.Test project, **When** package completeness tests are run, **Then** all required packages are present and functional
3. **Given** a test scenario with [Tool] attribute, **When** the test is executed in the Godot editor, **Then** it can be run without launching the full scene

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component fails to initialize during integration testing?
- How does the system handle communication timeouts between components?
- What if a required package is missing or corrupted?
- What if multiple test scenarios are attempted to run in parallel?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide integration tests that can run all infrastructure components in Godot场景
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify component communication between Mediator and EventBus components
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate package completeness for all NuGet packages (Contracts, Contexts, Infrastructure, Repositories, Core) in the framework
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all integration tests complete without errors when run in development environment only
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error reporting when integration tests fail
- **FR-006**: System MUST isolate integration tests to prevent side effects between test runs
- **FR-007**: System MUST only verify successful scenarios without error handling validation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide .tscn files for each test scenario
- **FR-009**: System MUST support [Tool] attribute for editor-based testing without scene execution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **IntegrationTestSuite**: Represents a collection of tests that verify the complete system functionality
- **ComponentCommunicationTest**: Represents tests that verify communication between framework components
- **PackageCompletenessTest**: Represents tests that verify all required packages are present and functional
- **TestScenario**: Represents a Godot scene-based test with associated .tscn file

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: 关于集成测试应该模拟哪种类型的生产环境？ → A: 通过godot的场景演示测试用例
- Q: 集成测试应该验证哪些具体的组件通信？ → A: 主要测试中介者和事件总线的通信
- Q: 测试应该在什么环境下运行？ → A: 仅在开发环境中运行
- Q: 测试应该验证哪些包的完整性？ → A: 所有NuGet包（Contracts, Contexts, Infrastructure, Repositories, Core）
- Q: 测试应该包括哪些类型的错误处理验证？ → A: 仅验证成功场景
- Q: 测试场景应该如何执行？ → A: 通过Godot编辑器手动逐个执行，使用[Tool]属性进行编辑器内测试
