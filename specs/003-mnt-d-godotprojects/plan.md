# Implementation Plan: Integration Tests for Production Infrastructure

**Branch**: `003-mnt-d-godotprojects` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: /mnt/d/GodotProjects/ModularGodot.Core/specs/003-mnt-d-godotprojects/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-mnt-d-godotprojects/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create integration tests in the ModularGodot.Core.Test directory that can run the complete production infrastructure to verify component communication (Mediator and EventBus) and package completeness (all NuGet packages) without errors. Tests should only verify successful scenarios and run in a development environment using Godot场景演示测试用例.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# (.NET 6.0 or higher)
**Primary Dependencies**: Godot.NET.Sdk/4.4.1, Autofac, MediatR, R3
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Godot Scene-based Integration Testing
**Target Platform**: Godot Engine with .NET
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: <100ms test execution time per test
**Constraints**: Tests must run only in development environment, only successful scenarios to be validated, must use Godot scenes for testing
**Scale/Scope**: Integration tests for 5 NuGet packages in the ModularGodot.Core framework

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Alignment with Core Principles

**I. Plugin-First Architecture**:
- The integration tests must validate the plugin-based architecture of ModularGodot.Core
- Tests will verify that all components follow the contract/implementation pattern
- Each NuGet package (Contracts, Contexts, Infrastructure, Repositories, Core) must be tested as a pluggable component

**II. Automated Dependency Management**:
- Tests must verify that services are properly registered via the `@Injectable` attribute system
- Dependency resolution through Autofac IoC container must be validated
- Constructor injection patterns must be tested

**III. Contract-Driven Development**:
- All integration tests must use interface contracts for component communication
- Commands and queries must be tested through the ICommand/IQuery interfaces
- Events must be tested via the event bus using typed event contracts

**IV. Event-Driven Architecture**:
- Communication between components must be tested through the R3 event system
- Publisher-subscriber decoupling must be validated
- Event immutability and semantic meaning must be verified

**V. Mediator Pattern for Command/Query Separation**:
- Commands and queries must be tested through the mediator pattern via the IDispatcher interface
- Business logic separation from command/query handling must be validated
- Single responsibility and consistent responses must be verified

### Architecture Standards Compliance
- Tests will validate the dual-package structure for each component
- Dependency order (Repository → Infrastructure → Contexts → Contracts) will be verified
- <1ms command routing performance will be measured where applicable
- Comprehensive unit tests and contract tests will be included

### Development Workflow Compliance
- Tests will follow .NET standard naming conventions
- Clear, descriptive test names will be used
- All tests must pass peer review requirements through automation

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with multiple NuGet packages following the ModularGodot.Core framework architecture. Integration tests will be implemented in the existing ModularGodot.Core.XUnitTests project and the new ModularGodot.Core.Test project.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All technical context items have been clarified through the /clarify process
   - No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain
   - Dependencies are well-defined: xUnit, Autofac, MediatR, R3
   - Integration patterns are established: Mediator pattern, Event-Driven Architecture

2. **Research tasks**:
   - Task: "Research best practices for integration testing in .NET with xUnit"
   - Task: "Research Autofac dependency injection patterns for integration testing"
   - Task: "Research MediatR mediator pattern testing approaches"
   - Task: "Research R3 event system testing strategies"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use existing ModularGodot.Core.XUnitTests project structure augmented with new integration tests
   - Rationale: Leverages existing test infrastructure and follows project conventions
   - Alternatives considered: Creating separate test projects, using different testing frameworks

**Output**: research.md with implementation approach for integration tests

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - IntegrationTestSuite: Collection of tests verifying system functionality
   - ComponentCommunicationTest: Tests verifying communication between Mediator and EventBus
   - PackageCompletenessTest: Tests verifying all required packages are present and functional
   - TestConfiguration: Configuration settings for integration tests
   - TestResult: Results of integration test execution

2. **Generate test contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Contract for Mediator component communication testing
   - Contract for EventBus component communication testing
   - Contract for package completeness validation
   - Contract for test isolation and side effect prevention

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - MediatorCommunicationContractTest.cs: Tests Mediator communication contracts
   - EventBusCommunicationContractTest.cs: Tests EventBus communication contracts
   - PackageCompletenessContractTest.cs: Tests package completeness contracts
   - TestIsolationContractTest.cs: Tests test isolation contracts

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Scenario 1: Integration tests running all infrastructure components in Godot场景演示测试用例
   - Scenario 2: Component communication verification between Mediator and EventBus
   - Scenario 3: Package completeness validation for all NuGet packages
   - Scenario 4: Successful test execution in development environment only

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - Add integration testing patterns for ModularGodot.Core framework
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing contract tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → test entity creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test implementation task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass
- Package completeness verification tasks
- Configuration and setup tasks for integration testing environment

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Test contracts before test implementations
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent test files)
- Group related tasks (Mediator tests, EventBus tests, Package tests)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Contract test creation (4 tasks)
- Integration test implementation (4 tasks)
- Package completeness verification (3 tasks)
- Test configuration and setup (3 tasks)
- Test documentation and quickstart (2 tasks)
- Validation and verification tasks (3 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
